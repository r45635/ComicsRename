# Safe Rename Feature - Status Summary

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The Safe Rename feature has been successfully implemented and is fully functional in ComicsRename. Here's the current status:

### 🎯 Core Features Implemented

1. **Qt-Native PDF Rendering**: Uses `QPdfDocument.render()` - same as QuickView
2. **Cover Comparison**: SSIM-based comparison with configurable threshold (0.7)
3. **Settings Integration**: Checkbox in Settings dialog with proper translations
4. **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Works with both button rename and DnD operations
5. **User Review Dialog**: Shows both images when covers don't match
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies or errors

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Primary**: `pdf_cover_comparator_qt.py` (Qt-native, no Poppler needed)
- **Fallback**: `pdf_cover_comparator.py` (Poppler-based, legacy)
- **UI**: `cover_comparison_dialog.py` (comparison dialog)
- **Settings**: Integrated into main settings dialog
- **Translations**: Full English/French support

### 📦 Dependencies

**Required (installed):**
- `opencv-python>=4.5.0` (image processing)
- `scikit-image>=0.19.0` (SSIM comparison)
- `PySide6>=6.4.0` (includes PDF support)

**No longer needed:**
- ~~pdf2image~~ (replaced with Qt-native)
- ~~poppler-utils~~ (replaced with Qt-native)

### 🧪 Testing Status

- ✅ All dependencies available
- ✅ Qt-native PDF rendering works
- ✅ Cover comparison dialog works
- ✅ Main application starts correctly
- ✅ Drag-and-drop metadata serialization works
- ✅ Translation system works correctly

### 🚀 Current Version

- **Application Version**: 3.4.3
- **Safe Rename Version**: Qt-native implementation
- **Documentation**: `SAFE_RENAME_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

## 🎉 READY FOR USE

The Safe Rename feature is:
- **Fully functional** for both button rename and drag-and-drop
- **Dependency-optimized** (no Poppler required)
- **User-friendly** with visual comparison dialog
- **Consistent** with existing QuickView functionality
- **Well-documented** with comprehensive guides

## 🔧 Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable Threshold**: Make SSIM threshold adjustable in settings
2. **Comic Format Support**: Extend to CBR/CBZ files using Qt
3. **Batch Processing**: Automatic decisions for multiple files
4. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and optimization for large files
5. **Advanced Comparison**: Multiple comparison algorithms
6. **User Feedback**: Learn from user decisions to improve accuracy

## 🏁 CONCLUSION

The Safe Rename feature meets all requirements and is ready for production use. It provides a robust, user-friendly way to prevent incorrect file renaming while maintaining consistency with the existing codebase.

**No further development needed for core functionality.**
