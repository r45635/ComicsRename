Hey comic lovers! 📚

I got tired of manually renaming thousands of comic files, so I built ComicsRename - a free tool that automatically fetches metadata from BDGest and ComicVine to organize your collection.

Features:
- Works with CBZ, CBR, PDF, and other formats
- Fetches series info, issue numbers, publication dates
- Bilingual (French/English) interface
- Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)

It's completely free and open source. I've been using it for my own collection and thought other collectors might find it useful too.

Demo site: https://r45635.github.io/ComicsRename/

Built this Python tool for organizing large comic collections using metadata from BDGest and ComicVine APIs.

Key features for data curation:
- Automatic metadata fetching and file renaming
- Batch processing for large collections  
- Standardized naming conventions

Perfect for digital archivists managing comic collections. Saves hours of manual organization work.
