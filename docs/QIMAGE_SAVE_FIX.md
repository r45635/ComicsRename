# QImage.save Fix Summary

## Problem
The SafeRename functionality was failing with the following error:
```
'PySide6.QtGui.QImage.save' called with wrong argument values:
  PySide6.QtGui.QImage.save('/var/folders/...', b'PNG')
Found signature:
  PySide6.QtGui.QImage.save(fileName: str, /, format: Union[bytes, bytearray, memoryview, NoneType] = None, quality: int = -1)
```

## Root Cause
In `pdf_cover_comparator_qt.py`, line 190, the `QImage.save()` method was being called with `b"PNG"` (bytes) as the format parameter, but the correct signature expects either:
- No format parameter (uses file extension)
- A string format parameter (works at runtime despite type checker warnings)
- A bytes format parameter (but with different encoding)

## Solution
Changed line 190 in `pdf_cover_comparator_qt.py` from:
```python
if not rendered_image.save(temp_file.name, b"PNG"):
```
to:
```python
if not rendered_image.save(temp_file.name):
```

## Why This Works
- The `QImage.save()` method can determine the format from the file extension (`.png`)
- This approach is more robust and doesn't rely on format parameter type issues
- The functionality remains the same but is now more reliable

## Testing
- Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix works correctly
- Confirmed that the main application imports without errors
- Verified that SafeRename functionality is operational
- Tested that PDF cover comparison can be created and used

## Status
âœ… **FIXED**: The QImage.save error has been resolved and SafeRename functionality is working correctly.

## Files Modified
- `/Users/vincentcruvellier/Documents/GitHub/ComicsRename/pdf_cover_comparator_qt.py` (line 190)

## Notes
- The type checker may still show warnings about string format parameters in other parts of the code, but these work correctly at runtime
- The fix maintains backward compatibility and doesn't change the behavior of the application
- No other files needed modification for this specific issue
