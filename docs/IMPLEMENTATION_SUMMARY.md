# Implementation Summary: BDGest Series Albums Fetching

## What has been implemented

### 1. New function in `bdgest_scraper_api.py`:
- **`fetch_albums_by_series_id(session, series_id, series_name=None, debug=True, verbose=False, log_path=None, fetch_details=True, max_workers=4)`**
  - Fetches albums for a specific series using the series ID
  - Uses the correct BDGest URL format: `ids={series_id}&s={encoded_series_name}`
  - Parses the HTML response to extract album information
  - **NEW**: Récupère les détails complets de chaque album (comme `fetch_albums`)
  - **NEW**: Utilise `fetch_details=True` par défaut pour récupérer les métadonnées complètes
  - **NEW**: Traitement en parallèle avec `max_workers=4` threads pour optimiser les performances
  - Returns a list of albums with metadata and detailed information in the "details" field

- **`get_bdgest_albums_by_series_id(series_id, series_name, username, password, debug=True, verbose=False, log_path=None, fetch_details=True, max_workers=4)`**  
  - Wrapper function that handles authentication and calls `fetch_albums_by_series_id`
  - **NEW**: Passe les paramètres `fetch_details` et `max_workers` à la fonction sous-jacente
  - Similar pattern to existing `get_bdgest_albums` and `get_bdgest_series` functions

### 2. New method in `BDGestProvider` class:
- **`search_albums_by_series_id(self, series_id, series_name, debug=False, verbose=False, fetch_details=True)`**
  - Integrates the new API function with the GUI provider system
  - Retrieves credentials from QSettings
  - **NEW**: Utilise `fetch_details=True` par défaut pour récupérer les détails complets
  - Calls the wrapper function with appropriate parameters

### 3. Updated GUI logic in `_search()` method:
- When in SeriesName mode and series results are found:
  - Populates the series dropdown with all found series
  - Stores series data in dropdown items for later use
  - **NEW**: Automatically triggers album population for the first series in the list
  - **NEW**: Calls `_populate_albums()` with the first series name to load albums immediately
  - Shows informative messages about the number of series found

### 4. Updated GUI logic in `_populate_albums()`:
- When in SeriesName mode (checkbox checked) and a series is selected:
  - Shows series details and cover image
  - Fetches albums for the selected series using the new function
  - Populates the album table with the retrieved albums
  - Displays appropriate messages for success/error states
- Added safety checks for checkbox availability to prevent attribute errors

### 5. URL Construction:
- Follows the BDGest URL pattern: `https://online.bdgest.com/albums/import?ids={series_id}&s={encoded_series_name}&t=&e=&c=&y=&ida=&a=&p=&f=&o=&lang=&dld=&cmin=&isbn=&dlf=&cmax=`
- Properly URL-encodes the series name
- Uses the series ID in the `ids` parameter as per BDGest's expected format

### 6. Documentation:
- Updated module docstring in `bdgest_scraper_api.py` to include new functions
- Added comprehensive docstrings for all new functions

## Key improvements in this update:

### ✅ **Album Details Integration:**
- `fetch_albums_by_series_id` now works exactly like `fetch_albums`
- Automatically fetches detailed metadata for each album using `fetch_album_details`
- Each album object now contains a "details" field with comprehensive information
- Parallel processing with configurable thread count (default: 4 workers)
- Option to disable detail fetching for faster results when not needed (`fetch_details=False`)

### ✅ **Performance Optimization:**
- Uses `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel detail fetching
- Configurable `max_workers` parameter to control concurrency
- Same optimization pattern as the original `fetch_albums` function

### ✅ **Performance Optimization - Session Management:**
- **Problem**: Every BDGest search was creating a new session and re-authenticating
- **Solution**: Implemented persistent session management in `BDGestProvider`:
  - `_session`: Persistent `requests.Session` object
  - `_authenticated`: Track authentication state
  - `_last_credentials`: Track credential changes
  - `_ensure_authenticated_session()`: Authenticate only when needed
  - `_invalidate_session()`: Force re-authentication when required
- **Benefits**: 
  - First search: Creates session + authenticates
  - Subsequent searches: Reuses existing authenticated session
  - Automatic re-authentication on errors or credential changes
  - Significant performance improvement for multiple searches

### ✅ **Auto-Population Enhancement:**
- When series are found and populated in SeriesName mode, the first series is automatically selected
- Albums for the first series are immediately loaded without requiring user interaction
- Provides immediate feedback and results to the user
- Improves user experience by showing content right away

### ✅ **Bug Fix - Unnecessary get_bdgest_albums Call:**
- **Problem**: When in SeriesName mode, `get_bdgest_albums` was still being called before `get_bdgest_series`
- **Root Cause**: The `_search()` method was calling `provider.search_series()` regardless of SeriesName mode
- **Solution**: Modified the search logic to only call `search_series()` when NOT in SeriesName mode for BDGest
- **Result**: Now in SeriesName mode, only `get_bdgest_series` is called, avoiding unnecessary album searches

### ✅ **UI Improvement - Removed Unnecessary Popup:**
- **Removed**: Popup message showing "X série(s) trouvée(s)" when series are found
- **Kept**: Alert popup only when no series are found in the search
- **Result**: Smoother user experience without interrupting workflow when results are found

### ✅ **UI Improvement - Close Dropdown Before Album Fetch:**
- **Problem**: When clicking on a series, dropdown stayed open while fetching albums, making GUI appear frozen
- **Solution**: Added intermediate method `_on_series_selection_changed()` that:
  1. Closes the dropdown immediately (`hidePopup()`)
  2. Forces UI update (`QApplication.processEvents()`)
  3. Then calls `_populate_albums()` to fetch albums
- **Result**: Better visual feedback, dropdown closes immediately, prevents appearance of frozen UI

## How it works:

1. User searches for series using SeriesName mode (checkbox checked)
2. Series results are populated in the dropdown
3. **NEW**: First series is automatically selected and its albums are immediately loaded
4. When user selects a different series from the dropdown:
   - The `_populate_albums()` method is triggered 
   - Series ID and name are extracted from the selected series data
   - `BDGestProvider.search_albums_by_series_id()` is called
   - This calls `get_bdgest_albums_by_series_id()` with authentication
   - Albums are fetched using the constructed URL with series ID
   - Album table is populated with the results
   - Series details and cover are displayed

## Error handling:
- Graceful handling of missing series ID or name
- Safety checks for UI elements that might not be initialized
- Exception handling with informative error messages
- Proper logging of debug information

## Testing:
- All imports work correctly
- URL construction follows the expected BDGest format
- Function availability verified
- Ready for end-to-end testing with actual BDGest credentials
