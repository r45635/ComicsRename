# File Deletion Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

A file deletion feature has been added to ComicsRename, allowing users to delete files directly from the context menu with confirmation. This feature enhances the application's file management capabilities while ensuring users don't accidentally delete files.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Functionality

✅ **Cross-Platform Utility Function**
- Added `delete_file_cross_platform` to `utils.py`
- Handles file deletion with proper error reporting
- Returns `True` for success or `(False, error_message)` for failure

✅ **Context Menu Integration**
- Added "Delete File" option to the file table context menu
- Appears alongside existing options (Open, Reveal, Quick View)
- Clear visual separation with menu separators

✅ **User Confirmation**
- Requires explicit confirmation before deletion
- Shows filename in the confirmation dialog
- Prevents accidental deletions

### 2. User Experience

✅ **Confirmation Dialog**
- Clear, specific confirmation message showing the file to be deleted
- Default button is "No" for safety
- Translated into both English and French

✅ **Feedback and Error Handling**
- Success message when file is deleted
- Clear error messages if deletion fails
- Automatic refresh of file list after successful deletion

### 3. Translation Support

✅ **English Translations Added**
- Menu item: "Delete File"
- Confirmation dialog title: "Confirm Deletion"
- Confirmation message: "Are you sure you want to delete the file..."
- Success message: "File has been successfully deleted"
- Error message: "Could not delete file..."

✅ **French Translations Added**
- Menu item: "Supprimer le fichier"
- Confirmation dialog title: "Confirmer la suppression"
- Confirmation message: "Êtes-vous sûr de vouloir supprimer le fichier..."
- Success message: "Le fichier a été supprimé avec succès"
- Error message: "Impossible de supprimer le fichier..."

## Testing

The deletion functionality has been tested with:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - `test_delete_file.py` verifies the core deletion function
   - Tests both successful deletion and error handling

2. **Integration**:
   - Verified context menu integration
   - Tested dialog appearance and translation
   - Confirmed UI feedback after deletion

## Usage

To delete a file:

1. Right-click on a file in the file list
2. Select "Delete File" from the context menu
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted
4. The file will be deleted and the list refreshed

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

While the current implementation meets the requirements, potential future enhancements could include:

- Multiple file selection and deletion
- Recycle bin/trash support instead of permanent deletion
- Keyboard shortcut (e.g., Delete key) support
